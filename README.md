I recently completed a data analysis project focused on the legendary Indian cricketer Virat Kohli and his ODI cricket journey from 2008 to 2022.

In this project:

I Utilized Power BI to create an interactive dashboard showcasing his cricket history.
Managed the back-end data using Excel and imported datasets from Kaggle.
Enhanced my understanding of various data science tools and significantly improved my data analysis skills.
